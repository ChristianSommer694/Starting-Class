###### Course: §126.33

## Computer Science 1

TechApps in Texas has six main strands based on the National Education Technology Standards and performance indicators based on the International Society for Technology in Education;  creativity and innovation; communication and collaboration; research and information fluency; critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making; digital citizenship; and technology operations and concepts. These are found across the different Tech Apps courses in Texas, including Computer Science.

Our Digital Art & Animation course is designed to be an introduction into the fundamentals of digital art and some of the related tools for students with limited to no background in digital art. This is not meant to replace traditional arts. One of the most important skills for a digital artist is a strong background in traditional art. No background in specialized software is required. Despite this, students are expected to start the course with a general computer skillset. Students should already be familiar with how to operate and utilize general softwares for everyday use.

Digital Art is an intermediate-level course, not introductory level. Prior to taking Digital Art, it is recommended for students to complete Digital Communications. Digital Art & Animation satisfies a students Fine Art Requirement for graduation in the state of Texas.

#### Course Summary

Digital Art & Animation is not designed to be a difficult course. However, students are often used to being told the answer, or able to just find the answer. This course requires students to design, document, and create their own solutions, then defend those solutions. Due to how limited this is in the American education system, it is not unusual for students to find the class difficult due to having to work and think in a way they are not used to. During the spring, students may choose to work with a partner or group. If they choose to, they are also responsible for documenting both their work and progress as an individual and as a group.
 
In addition to Adobe's Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash, students will also have the opportunity to work with SVG and other programs and tools. Students will also utilize GitHub throughout the year.

#### As an IB Continuum School

As an IB Continuum School, how we meet the expectations required by the state of Texas may look differently than what you'd see at other schools. The expectations set by Texas rarely match the significantly greater expectations of planning and evaluating found in IB. As such, many educational institutions in Texas expect very little planning and evaluation in their students work, instead often focusing on being able to recall a large amount of content. The International Baccalaureate has a greater focus on planning and evaluating, as well as on application of content instead of recall- especially in the design courses. 

The MYP technology and design courses develop skills linked to the design cycle, which provides the model of thinking and the strategy used to help students investigate problems and design, plan, create and evaluate the product. This is less of an issue in Tech Apps content in Texas, as the newer redefined expectations released in 2012 due reflect greater planning than previous expectations. To what extent and level of focus schools apply to this specific subset of Texas standards will vary, and will mostly likely be less at non-IB campuses.
 
Due to the structure IB expects, our courses tend 'cover' less content, instead choosing to focus on deeper more meaningful interaction between students and content. In the long run, students are better prepared for higher level work, instruction, and the real world. They tend to retain more as well, as they usually actually remember the content due to the significantly deeper understanding of use of content, instead of shallow memorization.
 
#### Lab Hours

Lab hours available for extra time or additional help. If you need guidance, please schedule an appointment. If you just need extra work time, pop-ins are allowed. If you choose not to work in class and are a distraction to others, and then ask to come in for extra time, you will likely be denied extra time. You should make use of the time you already have in scheduled class before requesting more.

Before School: Tuesday - Thursday
* 7:15 - 7:45 am

Lunch: A Days Only
* 12:55 - 1:30 pm

After School: Monday, Tuesday, & Thursday

If you need other accommodations, please see your instructor to make an appointment.


#### Computer Science Course Content
 
Our Computer Science course is designed to be an introduction into the ideas and fundamentals of programming for students with limited to no background in programming. That being said, students are expected to have previous knowledge of computers in general, and should be able to utilize basic everyday software and operating systems. No background in specialized software is required.
 
All students will learn how to create multiple programs by the end of the course. Students will have to plan and design their own programs, both independently and in working with others. The concepts of computer science and programming are embedded into the creation of various programs, there is an increased focus on planning, researching, and creating products in comparison to other Computer Science programs.

Our Computer Science course spans across 2 semesters. The course is broken up into 2 massive units.

**Fall Unit: Classical Encryption**
* What is Programming?
* Basic Programming in Python
* Origins of Programming
* Basic Encryption Techniques
* Design and Program a Rough Encryption Method

**Spring Unit: Text-based Games**
* History of Video Games
* Game Loops & Algorithm-planning
* Object Oriented Programming
* Design your own Text-based Game

For the traditional American education system, this is an elective. An elective does not mean you get a free A. An elective actually means you don't have to pass. You can excel in, barely pass, or fail this class. Which ever result you choose to pursue will be on your transcript, will affect your GPA, and will be included in what is sent to colleges and universities.
 
To IB, this subject area is just as important as any other, and should require rigorous and significant course work. You are expected to put forth a valiant effort consistently during class and throughout the year. The grade is a reflection of your choices; good or bad.

##### Concerns?
 
The bare minimum for passing in this region is a 70. If you are not doing the minimum of what is expected, you will most likely score below that. If you are just doing the minimum, your grade will likely fall around there. To excel, you should be creating work above the minimum expectations. If you are interested in programming, but are concerned about jumping into Computer Science 1, It's ok! The whole point of this course is to learn how to program. You aren't expected to already know how to program- where would you learn how if CS1 already expected you to know?
 
If you've never worked with code before, you can still do just fine. If you've taken Tech/Design courses already at WAIS, you've probably already worked with at least a little bit of code. Most of our Tech/Design courses have a couple assignments utilizing code to get you a little more comfortable with it.
 
If you're really concerned about working with code; consider looking into Fundamentals of CompSci and/or Digital Communications before taking Computer Science 1. We might not use the same languages, but you'll still learn how to create with code and be more comfortable in text-based environments.
 
#### Style of Instruction:
Majority of content will be delivered through video instruction. This allows you to revisit content as often as you need, as well as to be able to slow down, speed up, or repeat content as often as you need. This also allows your instructor to work with and help students or groups of students when they need, without stopping the content for the rest of students.
 
As you are able to work at your own pace, this can sometimes cause a general slowdown for some students. Despite being able to watch videos whenever you need, it is important that you keep up with the pace of the course to not end up with a ton of backwork to complete at the midterm or at term's end.

#### Cheating & Academic Dishonesty

##### Copyright & Intellectual Property:

All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. When it comes to art, many students struggle with understanding intellectual property. As such, it is generally recommended to avoid using copyrighted materials without first discussing it with your instructor.
 
Many students are under the belief that if it is for education, copyright and intellectual property laws don't apply. This is not the case. Many companies choose not to file charges when copyright or intellectual property laws are violated for educational use, but some companies do, and this doesn't mean they can't choose to at a later point in time. Use of other's works as your own, without proper documentation can result in loss of credit. However, use of copyrighted material can also result in legal issues in addition to any academic woes.

##### Collaboration vs Collusion:

All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. The form of academic dishonesty that seems to confuse students is collusion. Collusion is providing or receiving unauthorized aid or assistance. What is or isn't authorized can vary from course to course, so it is important that you communicate with, and understand the expectations of, your instructor.
 
Research, as well as personal experience, shows that students tend to understand content better when working with and discussing content with other students. Some assignments will actually require it. However, it is important that the aid and assistance you receive, or that you provide, is authorized. If you are physically touching another student's keyboard, mouse, or sending complete or partial chunks of code, you are likely engaging in collusion, not collaboration. If unsure, it's better to ask. Collusion is a form of academic dishonesty and can result in loss of credit for all parties involved.
